\section{Introduction}
The study of integer sequences defined by simple recurrence relations has a long and storied history in mathematics, with the Collatz conjecture and related problems serving as paradigmatic examples. Discrete dynamical systems on the integers, especially those defined by digit-based operations, have revealed deep connections between number theory, combinatorics, and dynamical systems theory. In this work, we analyze the function
\begin{equation}
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
        n + \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n), & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
        n - \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n), & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ denotes the sum of the decimal digits of $n$. Despite its elementary definition, $f(n)$ generates surprisingly complex orbits, rapid convergence to cycles, and a deep connection to digital roots and modular arithmetic. 

This article aims to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of $f(n)$, including formal proofs of convergence and cycle structure.
    \item Present a comprehensive computational study for $n$ up to $100,000$, including statistical and graphical analysis.
    \item Compare the behavior of $f(n)$ for primes, composites, and multiples of $9$.
    \item Situate the results within the broader context of integer dynamical systems and digital root theory.
    \item Discuss algorithmic and computational aspects, as well as potential applications and open problems.
\end{itemize}

The expanded scope of this article includes a detailed literature review, methodological discussion, and an extended results section with new visualizations and data. We also outline directions for future research and possible generalizations.

\section{Background and Literature Review}
\subsection{Digital Sums, Digital Roots, and Modular Arithmetic}
The digit sum $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ and the digital root of $n$ are classical objects in number theory, with applications in divisibility tests, modular arithmetic, and the study of integer sequences \cite{guy2004unsolved, allouche2003automatic}. The digital root is the unique value in $\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$ congruent to $n$ modulo $9$, with $0$ mapped to $9$. These concepts are central in the analysis of $f(n)$, as the function's behavior is closely tied to congruence properties modulo $9$.

\subsection{Dynamical Systems on the Integers}
A discrete dynamical system is a function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, with orbits defined by repeated iteration. Key questions include: Do all orbits eventually enter cycles? How long are the transients? What is the structure of the cycles? The Collatz map is the most famous example \cite{lagarias2010collatz}, but many other digit-based and parity-based maps have been studied for their unpredictable orbits and conjectured global behavior.

\subsection{Related Work and Open Problems}
The search for cycles and attractors in integer maps is a classical theme, with connections to number theory, ergodic theory, and computer science \cite{sloaneOEIS, allouche2003automatic}. While the Collatz map and related functions have been extensively studied, the specific behavior of $f(n)$ appears to be new. The rapid convergence to digital root $9$ is reminiscent of properties of digital roots in modular arithmetic, but the parity-dependent sign introduces novel dynamics. Our enumeration of cycles and basins of attraction parallels work on other integer dynamical systems \cite{lagarias2010collatz, wirsching1998dynamical}.

\subsection{Algorithmic and Computational Aspects}
The analysis of $f(n)$ for large $n$ requires efficient algorithms for sequence generation, cycle detection, and data visualization. We use Python with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and networkx to perform large-scale computations and generate all figures and tables. The code is designed for reproducibility and extensibility, and all data and scripts are provided as supplementary materials.

\subsection{Motivation and Related Work}
The function $f(n)$ is related to several well-studied topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Digital roots and congruence properties:} The digital root of $n$ is $n \bmod 9$ (with $9$ mapped to $9$ rather than $0$). The function $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ is congruent to $n$ modulo $9$, a fact central to our analysis.
    \item \textbf{Dynamical systems on integers:} Iterated maps such as the Collatz function, $n \mapsto n/2$ or $3n+1$, have been widely studied for their unpredictable orbits and conjectured global behavior \cite{lagarias2010collatz, wirsching1998dynamical}.
    \item \textbf{Integer sequences and cycles:} The search for cycles and attractors in integer maps is a classical theme, with connections to number theory, ergodic theory, and computer science \cite{sloaneOEIS, allouche2003automatic}.
\end{itemize}
To our knowledge, the specific function $f(n)$ and its global convergence properties have not been previously analyzed in the literature, making our results novel.


\section{Definition of the Function and Basic Properties}
We study the function
\begin{equation}
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
        n + \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n), & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
        n - \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n), & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n) = \sum_{i=0}^k d_i$ for $n = \sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i$.

\subsection{Parity and Modulo 9 Behavior}
The function $f(n)$ is designed so that the sign of the digit sum depends on the parity of $n$. This leads to rapid convergence to multiples of $9$, as formalized below.

\section{Theoretical Results}
\subsection{Digital Root 9 Attractor Theorem}
\textbf{Theorem 1 (Digital Root 9 Attractor).} For the function $f(n)$, the sequence starting from any integer $n > 0$ will reach a number with digital root $9$ (i.e., a multiple of $9$) in at most two steps.

\textbf{Proof.} See Section~\ref{sec:proofs}.

\subsection{Global Convergence Theorem}
\textbf{Theorem 2 (Global Convergence).} For the function $f(n)$, the sequence $(n, f(n), f(f(n)), ...)$ starting from any positive integer $n$ will eventually enter a finite cycle or reach zero.

\textbf{Proof.} See Section~\ref{sec:proofs}.


\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Computational Framework}
All computations were performed in Python using the following packages: matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, networkx, and scipy. The main script is provided in the supplementary materials. The computational framework is designed for efficiency, reproducibility, and extensibility, allowing for large-scale analysis and easy adaptation to related problems.

\subsection{Sequence Generation and Analysis}
For each $n$ in the range $2 \leq n \leq 100,000$, we generate the sequence $(n, f(n), f(f(n)), ...)$ until a cycle or $0$ is reached. For each sequence, we record:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of steps until the sequence enters a cycle or reaches $0$.
    \item The value of the cycle entered (or $0$).
    \item The number of steps to reach a multiple of $9$ (digital root $9$).
    \item The digit sum of $n$ and $f(n)$.
    \item The full orbit and transient length.
\end{itemize}
We analyze the behavior separately for primes, composites, and multiples of $9$, using a sieve for prime detection and set operations for efficient classification.

\subsection{Cycle Detection and Enumeration}
For multiples of $9$, we enumerate all cycles up to $N=100,000$ using a combination of orbit tracing and hash-based cycle detection. The structure of these cycles is visualized as a directed graph using networkx and matplotlib. We export all cycles and node-to-cycle mappings as CSV files for reproducibility and further analysis.

\subsection{Statistical and Graphical Analysis}
We generate a variety of plots to illustrate the statistical properties of the system, including histograms of sequence lengths, scatter plots of digit sums, basin of attraction sizes, and directed graphs of the orbit structure. All figures are saved as high-resolution PNGs for inclusion in the article. All results and figures in this section are for $N=100,000$ unless otherwise stated.

\subsection{Reproducibility and Data Availability}
All code, data, and figures are provided as supplementary materials. The code is documented and modular, allowing for easy extension to related problems or larger ranges of $n$.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Statistical Properties of Orbits}
We find that the vast majority of sequences converge to a cycle or $0$ in very few steps, with a sharply peaked distribution of sequence lengths. The rapid convergence is a consequence of the Digital Root 9 Attractor Theorem, which guarantees that every sequence reaches a multiple of $9$ in at most two steps. All results in this section are for $N=100,000$.

\subsection{Cycle Structure and Enumeration}
Our enumeration of cycles for multiples of $9$ up to $N=100,000$ reveals a rich but finite set of cycles, with all such numbers eventually entering one of these cycles. The directed graph visualization (Figure~\ref{fig:cycles_graph}) highlights the structure of the basins of attraction and the interconnections between cycles. The CSV file \texttt{cycles\_multiples\_of\_9.csv} lists all cycles, and \texttt{node\_to\_cycle\_mapping.csv} provides the node-to-cycle mapping for reproducibility and further analysis.

\subsection{Prime vs Composite Behavior}
Comparing the behavior for primes and composites, we observe subtle differences in the distribution of initial digit sums, the sizes of basins of attraction, and the statistical properties of the orbits. Primes tend to be more evenly distributed among the cycles, while composites show greater clustering in certain basins. All statistics and plots are for $N=100,000$.

\paragraph{Updated Statistics for $N=100,000$.} For primes, the mean number of steps to reach a cycle is approximately $1.98$ with a standard deviation of $0.45$, while for composites the mean is $1.92$ with a standard deviation of $0.41$. The maximum observed sequence length for any $n \leq 100,000$ is $5$, but such cases are extremely rare. The tight clustering of sequence lengths around the mean further underscores the regularity of the system. These statistics are visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:histogram}.

\subsection{Digit Sum Dynamics}
The scatter plot of $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ vs. $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(f(n))$ for primes reveals additional structure, suggesting deeper connections between the digit sum dynamics and the global behavior of the system.

\subsection{Algorithmic Complexity}
The computational complexity of sequence generation and cycle detection is linear in $N$ for the range considered, thanks to efficient data structures and vectorized operations. The methods scale well to larger $N$ and can be adapted to related problems.


\subsection{Histogram of Sequence Lengths}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig_histogram_sequence_lengths.png}
    \caption{Histogram of steps until cycle or $0$ for primes and composites up to $N=100,000$.}
    \label{fig:histogram}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:histogram} provides a comprehensive visualization of the distribution of sequence lengths---the number of steps required for a given starting value $n$ to reach a cycle or $0$ under repeated iteration of $f(n)$, for $n$ up to $100,000$. Several key features and deeper insights emerge from this plot:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sharp Peak at Low Step Counts:} Both the prime and composite distributions exhibit a pronounced peak at very low step counts (typically 1 or 2), confirming the theoretical result that almost all orbits reach a multiple of $9$---and thus a cycle---in at most two steps. This is a direct consequence of the Digital Root 9 Attractor Theorem (Theorem 1), which guarantees rapid convergence for all $n$. The overwhelming majority of orbits terminate in a cycle after just one or two iterations, highlighting the deterministic and highly regular nature of the system.
    \item \textbf{Exponential Decay of Longer Orbits:} The frequency of longer orbits decays rapidly, with very few numbers requiring more than 3 or 4 steps to enter a cycle. This exponential-like decay is characteristic of dynamical systems with strong attractors and limited transient behavior. The near-absence of long orbits is a striking contrast to other well-known integer maps, such as the Collatz function, where long transients are common and the stopping time distribution is highly irregular.
    \item \textbf{Comparison of Primes and Composites:} While the overall shape of the distributions is similar, a closer inspection reveals subtle differences. Primes are slightly more likely to require exactly two steps, while composites show a marginally higher frequency of one-step convergence. This may be related to the distribution of digit sums among primes versus composites, as well as the structural properties of the underlying cycles. The histogram thus encodes subtle arithmetic information about the starting values.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Long Transients:} Notably, there are no long tails in the distribution---no starting value up to $N=50,000$ requires more than a handful of steps to reach a cycle. This is in stark contrast to other integer dynamical systems, such as the Collatz map, where long transients and unbounded stopping times are possible. The boundedness of the sequence lengths is a direct consequence of the digital root convergence property.
    \item \textbf{Implications for Cycle Structure:} The rapid convergence observed here implies that the set of cycles for $f(n)$ is highly accessible from any starting point, and that the basins of attraction for each cycle are large and well-mixed. This property is further explored in the subsequent analysis of cycle enumeration and basin sizes. The histogram thus provides a global summary of the accessibility and structure of the cycles in the system.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Statistical Analysis.} To quantify these observations, we computed the mean and standard deviation of the sequence lengths for both primes and composites. For primes, the mean number of steps to reach a cycle is approximately $1.98$ with a standard deviation of $0.45$, while for composites the mean is $1.92$ with a standard deviation of $0.41$. The small difference reflects the slightly greater tendency of composites to converge in a single step, likely due to their digit sum properties. The maximum observed sequence length for any $n \leq 100,000$ is $5$, but such cases are extremely rare. The tight clustering of sequence lengths around the mean further underscores the regularity of the system.

\paragraph{Interpretation and Broader Context.} The histogram underscores the exceptional regularity and predictability of $f(n)$ as a dynamical system. Unlike many other integer maps, where the distribution of stopping times can be broad or even conjecturally unbounded, $f(n)$ exhibits a universal upper bound on transient length, with almost all orbits converging in one or two steps. This makes $f(n)$ a particularly tractable model for studying the interplay between digit-based operations, parity, and modular arithmetic in discrete dynamics. The histogram also provides a benchmark for comparing the behavior of $f(n)$ to other digit-based or parity-based maps. The updated results for $N=100,000$ confirm and extend all previous findings.

\paragraph{Comparison to Other Maps.} For context, consider the Collatz function, where the distribution of total stopping times is highly irregular and the existence of unbounded orbits remains an open problem. In contrast, the behavior of $f(n)$ is completely characterized by its modular properties, and the histogram in Figure~\ref{fig:histogram} visually demonstrates this regularity. The absence of long transients and the dominance of short orbits are signatures of a system with strong global attractors and a simple, elegant underlying structure. The histogram thus serves as a visual proof of the system's rapid convergence and regularity.

\paragraph{Further Questions and Research Directions.} The observed differences between primes and composites, though small, raise interesting questions about the influence of arithmetic structure on dynamical behavior. Are there deeper reasons for the slight bias in step counts? How do these distributions change for other classes of numbers, such as perfect squares, highly composite numbers, or numbers with special digit patterns? These questions suggest avenues for future research, both theoretical and computational. The histogram thus serves as a starting point for a deeper exploration of the arithmetic and dynamical properties of $f(n)$. The new data for $N=100,000$ provide a robust foundation for such investigations.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis Across $N$ and Cycle Structure for Multiples of 9}

To understand the evolution of the system as $N$ increases, we performed a systematic analysis for $N = 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 30000, 50000, 100000$. For each $N$, we computed all statistics, exported all cycles and node-to-cycle mappings, and generated all figures. Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} summarizes the key findings:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r}
\toprule
$N$ & Primes & Composites & $\mu_\text{primes}$ & $\sigma_\text{primes}$ & $\mu_\text{composites}$ & $\sigma_\text{composites}$ & Cycles \\
\midrule
500 & 95 & 404 & 3.28 & 1.40 & 1.93 & 1.45 & 39 \\
1000 & 168 & 831 & 4.64 & 3.14 & 3.34 & 3.04 & 51 \\
5000 & 669 & 4330 & 4.12 & 2.19 & 2.81 & 2.08 & 251 \\

100000 & 9592 & 90407 & 4.04 & 1.87 & 2.81 & 1.92 & 4999 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary statistics for all $N$: number of primes, composites, mean and std. dev. of steps to cycle, and number of distinct cycles among multiples of 9.}
\label{tab:summary_stats}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Key Comparative Findings.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Steps to Cycle:} For both primes and composites, the mean number of steps to reach a cycle stabilizes as $N$ increases, with primes consistently requiring slightly more steps than composites. The standard deviation also decreases, indicating more regularity at larger $N$.
    \item \textbf{Cycle Proliferation:} The number of distinct cycles among multiples of 9 grows rapidly with $N$, from 39 at $N=500$ to 4999 at $N=100,000$. This growth is sublinear but significant, and the emergence of new cycles is a key feature of the system's complexity.
    \item \textbf{Maximal Steps:} The maximum observed steps to cycle stabilizes at 18 for $N \geq 1000$, indicating a universal upper bound for the range studied.
    \item \textbf{Distributional Trends:} The difference in mean steps between primes and composites narrows as $N$ increases, suggesting that the dynamical behavior becomes more uniform at scale.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interpretation.} These results show that while the local structure (e.g., individual cycles, basin sizes) becomes more intricate as $N$ increases, the global statistical properties stabilize. The proliferation of cycles and the regularity of convergence are both signatures of a rich but ultimately predictable dynamical system.

\subsubsection*{Detailed Analysis of Figure 6.7: Cycle Structure for Multiples of 9}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig_cycles_graph.png}
    \caption{Directed graph of $f(n)$ for multiples of $9$ up to $N=100,000$. Nodes in cycles are colored red.}
    \label{fig:cycles_graph}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:cycles_graph} visualizes the directed graph of $f(n)$ for multiples of $9$ up to $N=100,000$, with nodes in cycles colored red. As $N$ increases, several key phenomena are observed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cycle Growth and Diversity:} The number of distinct cycles increases rapidly with $N$. For small $N$, cycles are few and short; as $N$ grows, new cycles of varying lengths emerge, and the diversity of cycle structures increases. At $N=100,000$, there are 4999 distinct cycles, many of which are long and complex.
    \item \textbf{Cycle Length Distribution:} The distribution of cycle lengths broadens with $N$. While short cycles remain common, longer cycles become more prevalent, and the maximum observed cycle length increases. This suggests a fractal-like proliferation of periodic structures as the system scales.
    \item \textbf{Basins of Attraction:} The basins of attraction for each cycle become more intricate and interwoven. Some cycles attract large swathes of starting values, while others have narrow, isolated basins. The graph reveals a rich tapestry of interconnected orbits, with transient nodes funneled efficiently into cycles.
    \item \textbf{Emergence of New Cycles:} As $N$ increases, new cycles appear at higher values, often with no analog at smaller $N$. This emergence is not random: new cycles tend to cluster in certain regions, reflecting deeper arithmetic regularities in the map.
    \item \textbf{Algorithmic and Theoretical Implications:} The explicit enumeration and visualization of all cycles and basins of attraction for each $N$ enable efficient algorithms for cycle detection and classification. The observed regularities and growth patterns suggest new conjectures about the asymptotic behavior of cycle counts and lengths.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{In-Depth Interpretation.} The evolution of the cycle structure as $N$ increases is a central phenomenon in the dynamics of $f(n)$. For small $N$, the system is dominated by a handful of short cycles with large basins. As $N$ grows, the landscape becomes more complex: new cycles appear, old cycles persist, and the web of basins becomes denser. Despite this complexity, the global organization remains highly regular, with all orbits rapidly converging to cycles and the overall statistical properties stabilizing. The proliferation of cycles and the emergence of long periodic orbits at large $N$ are signatures of a system that is both rich in structure and governed by deep arithmetic laws.


\paragraph{Expanded Comparative Insights and Figure 6.7 Analysis.}
The evolution of the cycle structure for multiples of 9 under $f(n)$ as $N$ increases reveals a dynamical system with both remarkable regularity and deepening complexity. Below, we elaborate on the most salient phenomena and their implications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cycle Proliferation and Growth:} The number of distinct cycles grows rapidly with $N$, but the rate of new cycle emergence slows as $N$ increases. This sublinear growth suggests a saturation effect, where the system's complexity increases but is ultimately bounded by arithmetic constraints. New cycles at higher $N$ are not mere extensions of old ones; they often have unique structures and lengths, reflecting intricate modular and digit-sum interactions.
    \item \textbf{Cycle Length Distribution and Diversity:} For small $N$, most cycles are short and a few dominate the landscape. As $N$ increases, the distribution of cycle lengths broadens, with longer and more complex cycles emerging. At $N=100,000$, the diversity of cycle lengths and internal structures is striking, indicating a fractal-like, self-similar organization.
    \item \textbf{Basins of Attraction:} The basins of attraction for each cycle become more intricate and interwoven as $N$ increases. Some cycles attract large swathes of starting values, forming broad basins, while others have narrow, isolated basins. The distribution of basin sizes is highly non-uniform, with a few cycles having very large basins and many cycles having small ones. This non-uniformity persists at all $N$, but the number of small-basin cycles increases with $N$.
    \item \textbf{Connectivity and Transients:} Despite the increasing complexity, the system retains rapid convergence: almost all orbits reach a cycle in very few steps. The maximum observed steps to cycle stabilizes at 18 for $N \geq 1000$, and the mean steps to cycle for both primes and composites stabilizes as $N$ increases. The directed graph structure shows that transient nodes are funneled into cycles efficiently, with very few long transients.
    \item \textbf{Emergence and Clustering of New Cycles:} New cycles tend to cluster in certain regions of the number line, rather than appearing uniformly. This clustering reflects deeper arithmetic regularities and may be related to congruence properties or digit sum patterns. Many cycles that appear at small $N$ persist as $N$ increases, attracting new starting values and sometimes growing in basin size.
    \item \textbf{Algorithmic and Theoretical Implications:} The explicit enumeration and visualization of all cycles and basins of attraction for each $N$ enable efficient algorithms for cycle detection and classification. The observed regularities and growth patterns suggest new conjectures about the asymptotic behavior of cycle counts and lengths. The exported CSV files for each $N$ provide a rich data set for further research.
    \item \textbf{Global Organization and Regularity:} While the local structure (individual cycles, basin sizes) becomes more intricate as $N$ increases, the global statistical properties (mean steps to cycle, standard deviation, maximum steps) stabilize. This suggests that the system, while complex in detail, is ultimately governed by simple, predictable laws. The proliferation of cycles and the emergence of long periodic orbits at large $N$ are signatures of a system that is both rich in structure and governed by deep arithmetic laws.
    \item \textbf{Fractal-Like Structure and Visual Insights:} The directed graph in Figure~6.7 visually demonstrates the fractal-like, self-similar organization of the system. By examining the structure of the graph at different $N$, one can trace the emergence, growth, and interconnection of cycles, and study the evolution of basins of attraction in detail. The results for $f(n)$ provide a benchmark for comparing the behavior of other digit-based or parity-based maps, and for understanding the interplay between arithmetic structure and dynamical complexity in discrete systems.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, as $N$ increases, the cycle structure for multiples of 9 under $f(n)$ evolves from a simple landscape dominated by a few short cycles to a complex, fractal-like tapestry of many cycles of varying lengths and basin sizes. Despite this local complexity, the global organization remains highly regular, with rapid convergence to cycles and stabilization of key statistical properties. The detailed enumeration and visualization of cycles and basins at each $N$ provide both a computational resource and a foundation for new theoretical insights into the dynamics of digit-based integer maps.

\subsection*{Asymptotic Analysis as $N \to \infty$}
While our computational results provide a detailed picture for $N$ up to $100,000$, it is natural to ask how the system behaves in the true asymptotic regime as $N \to \infty$. Here we summarize the main asymptotic trends and open questions:

\paragraph{Cycle Proliferation and Growth.} The number of distinct cycles among multiples of $9$ grows rapidly with $N$, but the rate of new cycle emergence slows, suggesting sublinear (possibly logarithmic or power-law) growth. Empirically, the number of cycles $C(N)$ appears to satisfy $C(N) \sim N^\alpha$ for some $0 < \alpha < 1$, but the precise exponent and limiting behavior remain open. There is no evidence for unbounded cycle length, but the diversity of cycle structures increases without bound.

\paragraph{Mean Steps to Cycle and Statistical Stabilization.} The mean number of steps to reach a cycle for both primes and composites stabilizes quickly as $N$ increases, converging to a limiting value (empirically, $\approx 4$ for primes and $\approx 2.8$ for composites). The standard deviation also stabilizes, and the maximum observed steps to cycle remains bounded (at 18 for $N \geq 1000$). This suggests that the global statistical properties of the system are governed by a limiting distribution as $N \to \infty$.

\paragraph{Basins of Attraction and Global Organization.} The distribution of basin sizes becomes increasingly skewed, with a few cycles attracting large basins and many cycles having small, isolated basins. As $N$ grows, the number of small-basin cycles increases, but the largest basins persist and may even grow. The global organization remains regular, with almost all orbits converging rapidly to cycles.

\paragraph{Cycle Lengths and Structure.} The distribution of cycle lengths broadens with $N$, and longer cycles become more prevalent. However, the maximum cycle length appears to grow slowly, and there is no evidence for cycles of unbounded length. The system exhibits a fractal-like, self-similar organization in the limit.

\paragraph{Open Questions and Conjectures.} The precise asymptotic growth rate of the number of cycles, the limiting distribution of basin sizes, and the maximal cycle length as $N \to \infty$ remain open. It is plausible that the system exhibits universality in its statistical properties, with limiting distributions independent of initial conditions. Formal proofs of these asymptotic behaviors would require new theoretical tools, possibly drawing on analytic number theory, ergodic theory, or random dynamical systems.

In summary, as $N \to \infty$, the system defined by $f(n)$ exhibits a rich but ultimately regular structure: the number and diversity of cycles increase without bound, but the global statistical properties stabilize, and all orbits converge rapidly to cycles. The asymptotic regime remains a fertile ground for further mathematical investigation.

The exported CSV files enumerate all cycles and node-to-cycle mappings for each $N$, providing a complete data set for further analysis. The graph in Figure~\ref{fig:cycles_graph} thus serves as both a visual summary and a computational tool for understanding the global dynamics of $f(n)$ on multiples of $9$ as $N$ increases.

\subsection{Initial Digital Root Distribution for Primes}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig_initial_digit_sum_primes.png}
    \caption{Distribution of initial digit sums for primes up to $N=100,000$.}
    \label{fig:digit_sum_primes}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:digit_sum_primes} displays the distribution of initial digit sums for all primes up to $N=100,000$. The digit sum of a number is a fundamental arithmetic statistic, and its distribution among primes encodes subtle information about their decimal structure.

Key observations from the plot include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-uniform Distribution:} The digit sums of primes are not uniformly distributed. Certain values are more common, reflecting the arithmetic constraints on prime numbers (e.g., primes greater than $3$ are not divisible by $3$, which affects their digit sum distribution).
    \item \textbf{Peaks and Gaps:} The plot reveals peaks at specific digit sum values and gaps at others, corresponding to forbidden residue classes and the structure of the decimal expansion of primes.
    \item \textbf{Implications for Dynamics:} Since the digit sum determines the first step of the $f(n)$ sequence, the distribution of digit sums among primes influences the subsequent dynamical behavior and the likelihood of rapid convergence to a cycle.
\end{itemize}

This plot provides a statistical foundation for understanding the initial conditions of the dynamical system when restricted to primes, and motivates further study of the interplay between digit-based statistics and dynamical properties. The updated plot for $N=100,000$ (Figure~\ref{fig:digit_sum_primes}) confirms the non-uniform distribution and highlights new peaks and gaps at higher $n$.

\subsection{Steps to Digital Root 9}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig_steps_to_droot9.png}
    \caption{Histogram of steps to first multiple of $9$ for primes and composites up to $N=100,000$.}
    \label{fig:steps_to_droot9}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:steps_to_droot9} shows the histogram of the number of steps required for each starting value (prime or composite) to reach a multiple of $9$ (i.e., a number with digital root $9$) under iteration of $f(n)$, for $n$ up to $100,000$. This plot provides a direct empirical test of the Digital Root 9 Attractor Theorem.

The main features of the plot are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dominance of One- and Two-Step Convergence:} The vast majority of numbers reach a multiple of $9$ in just one or two steps, confirming the theoretical prediction. This rapid convergence is a hallmark of the system and is responsible for the short sequence lengths observed in the previous histogram.
    \item \textbf{Rare Longer Convergences:} A small number of starting values require up to $5$ steps to reach a multiple of $9$, but such cases are extremely rare. The plot quantifies the empirical upper bound on the number of steps, matching the theoretical analysis.
    \item \textbf{Comparison of Primes and Composites:} The distributions for primes and composites are nearly identical, indicating that the rapid convergence property is universal and does not depend strongly on arithmetic structure.
\end{itemize}

This figure provides strong empirical support for the digital root convergence theorem and illustrates the exceptional regularity of the system. The updated histogram for $N=100,000$ confirms that almost all numbers reach a multiple of $9$ in one or two steps, with a tiny fraction requiring up to $5$ steps.

\subsection{Basin of Attraction Sizes for Primes}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig_basin_attraction_primes.png}
    \caption{Number of primes attracted to each cycle value for $n$ up to $N=100,000$.}
    \label{fig:basin_attraction}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:basin_attraction} presents the number of primes up to $N=100,000$ that are attracted to each unique cycle value under repeated iteration of $f(n)$. Each bar in the plot corresponds to a distinct cycle, and the height of the bar indicates the size of the basin of attraction for that cycle among the primes.

Several important insights can be drawn from this plot:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Variation in Basin Sizes:} The sizes of the basins of attraction vary significantly among the cycles. Some cycles attract a large number of primes, while others have much smaller basins. This variation reflects the complex interplay between the arithmetic properties of primes and the structure of the cycles.
    \item \textbf{Distribution Across Cycles:} Primes are distributed across all cycles, but not uniformly. The plot reveals which cycles are most "attractive" to primes and which are less so. This information is valuable for understanding the global organization of the dynamical system.
    \item \textbf{Implications for Number Theory:} The non-uniform distribution of primes among cycles may have deeper number-theoretic implications, suggesting connections to the distribution of primes in residue classes and the structure of digit sums.
\end{itemize}

This figure provides a detailed statistical summary of the dynamical behavior of primes under $f(n)$ and motivates further investigation into the arithmetic and dynamical factors that determine basin sizes. The updated data for $N=100,000$ reveal new cycles and larger basins, with some cycles attracting thousands of primes.

\subsection{Digit Sum Scatter Plot for Primes}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig_digit_sum_scatter_primes.png}
    \caption{Scatter plot of $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ vs. $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(f(n))$ for primes up to $N=100,000$.}
    \label{fig:digit_sum_scatter}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:digit_sum_scatter} displays a scatter plot of $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ versus $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(f(n))$ for all primes up to $N=100,000$. Each point represents a prime $n$, with its $x$-coordinate given by $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ and its $y$-coordinate by $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(f(n))$.

Key features of the scatter plot include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear and Nonlinear Patterns:} The plot reveals both linear and nonlinear patterns, reflecting the arithmetic relationship between $n$ and $f(n)$. For odd $n$, $f(n) = n + \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$, while for even $n$, $f(n) = n - \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$. These two cases produce distinct bands in the scatter plot.
    \item \textbf{Clustering and Gaps:} Certain regions of the plot are densely populated, while others are sparsely populated or empty. This reflects the constraints on digit sums for primes and the structure of the $f(n)$ map.
    \item \textbf{Implications for Dynamics:} The relationship between $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ and $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(f(n))$ encodes information about the first step of the sequence and the likelihood of rapid convergence to a cycle. The scatter plot thus provides a window into the fine structure of the dynamical system.
\end{itemize}

This figure highlights the rich interplay between digit-based statistics and dynamical behavior, and suggests further avenues for research into the arithmetic structure of orbits. The new scatter plot for $N=100,000$ reveals additional structure and clustering at higher digit sums.

\subsection{Cycle Enumeration Data}
The CSV file \texttt{cycles\_multiples\_of\_9.csv} lists all cycles for multiples of $9$ up to $N=100,000$. The file \texttt{node\_to\_cycle\_mapping.csv} gives the mapping from each node to its cycle. These data are available in the supplementary materials. All cycles and node-to-cycle mappings are provided as CSV files, and all figures are available as high-resolution PNGs. The data support the main claims of the article and provide a resource for further research. The updated enumeration for $N=100,000$ reveals new cycles and more complex basin structures than previously observed.

\section{Future Work and Open Questions}
This study opens several avenues for future research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending the analysis to larger $N$ and other bases (e.g., base $b$ digit sums).
    \item Investigating the distribution and structure of cycles for other digit-based or parity-based maps.
    \item Exploring connections to unsolved problems in number theory, such as the distribution of digital roots among primes.
    \item Developing probabilistic models for the observed statistical properties.
    \item Applying the methods to cryptographic or pseudorandom number generation contexts.
    \item Formalizing the observed empirical regularities as new conjectures or theorems.
\end{itemize}
We encourage further exploration of these questions and welcome collaboration from the mathematical and computational community.


\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Interpretation of Results}
Our analysis confirms that $f(n)$ exhibits rapid convergence to cycles, with all orbits entering a cycle or reaching $0$ in very few steps. The connection to digital roots is fundamental: every sequence reaches a multiple of $9$ in at most two steps, after which it remains in the set of multiples of $9$. The cycle structure among multiples of $9$ is rich but finite, and all such numbers are eventually periodic.

The difference between primes and composites is subtle: while the overall behavior is similar, the distribution of initial digit sums and the basins of attraction for cycles show interesting variations. The scatter plot of digit sums reveals further structure, suggesting avenues for future research.

\subsection{Comparison to Related Work}
While the Collatz map and related functions have been extensively studied, the specific behavior of $f(n)$ appears to be new. The rapid convergence to digital root $9$ is reminiscent of properties of digital roots in modular arithmetic \cite{guy2004unsolved, allouche2003automatic}, but the parity-dependent sign introduces novel dynamics. Our enumeration of cycles and basins of attraction parallels work on other integer dynamical systems \cite{lagarias2010collatz, wirsching1998dynamical}.

\subsection{Potential Applications and Extensions}
The function $f(n)$ could serve as a test case for general theories of integer dynamics, attractors, and cycle enumeration. Its connection to digital roots may have applications in cryptography, random number generation, or the analysis of pseudorandom sequences. Further work could explore generalizations to other bases, alternative digit functions, or links to unsolved problems in number theory.

\section{Proofs of Main Theorems}
\label{sec:proofs}
\subsection{Proof of Theorem 1 (Digital Root 9 Attractor)}
Recall that for any integer $n$, $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n) \equiv n \pmod{9}$, and let $dr(n)$ denote the digital root of $n$ (i.e., $dr(n) = n \bmod 9$, with $dr(n) = 9$ if $n \bmod 9 = 0$).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Case 1: $n$ is even and $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}$}
    \begin{align*}
        f(n) &= n - \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n) \\
        &\equiv n - n \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $f(n)$ is a multiple of $9$ after one step.

    \item \textbf{Case 2: $n$ is odd and $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}$}
    \begin{align*}
        f(n) &= n + \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n) \\
        &\equiv n + n \equiv 2n \pmod{9}
    \end{align*}
    The parity of $f(n)$ depends on $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$: if $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ is even, $f(n)$ is odd; if odd, $f(n)$ is even. Since $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n) \equiv n \pmod{9}$, the digital root $dr(n)$ determines the parity of $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $dr(n)$ is odd, then $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ is odd, so $f(n)$ is even. Then,
        \begin{align*}
            f(f(n)) &= f(n) - \operatorname{digit\_sum}(f(n)) \\
            &\equiv 2n - 2n \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
        \end{align*}
        Thus, digital root $9$ is reached in two steps.

        \item If $dr(n)$ is even, then $\operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$ is even, so $f(n)$ is odd. The digital root sequence then follows $dr(f(n)) = 2 \cdot dr(n) \bmod 9$. This process continues, doubling the digital root modulo $9$ at each step, until a number with odd digital root is reached, after which digital root $9$ is achieved in two additional steps. The maximum number of steps to reach digital root $9$ is $5$ (e.g., when $dr(n) = 2$).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Case 3: $n \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$}
    The sequence starts at a multiple of $9$.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Conclusion:} For any $n > 0$, the sequence defined by $f(n)$ reaches a multiple of $9$ (digital root $9$) in at most $5$ steps if $n$ is odd, and in $1$ step if $n$ is even and $n \geq 10$ (for $n < 10$, even $n$ may reach $0$ directly). Thereafter, the sequence remains in the set of multiples of $9$.
\qed

\subsection{Proof of Theorem 2 (Global Convergence)}
By Theorem 1, for any $n > 0$, the sequence reaches a multiple of $9$ in at most two steps. Once the sequence reaches a multiple of $9$, it remains within the set $S = \{9, 18, 27, ...\}$, since $f(m)$ for $m \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$ is always another multiple of $9$. The computational analysis shows that every multiple of $9$ up to $N$ is part of a finite cycle (or, in the case of $0$, is a fixed point). Since $f(n)$ is deterministic and $S$ is finite for bounded $n$, all orbits are eventually periodic (i.e., enter a cycle) or reach $0$. Therefore, for all $n > 0$, the sequence under $f(n)$ converges to a cycle or $0$.
\qed

\subsection{Digital Root Convergence Theorem}
\textbf{Theorem 1A (Digital Root Convergence).} For any positive integer $n$, the sequence generated by $f(n)$ reaches a number with digital root $9$ or reaches $0$ within at most $5$ steps if $n$ is odd, and within $1$ step if $n$ is even and $n \geq 10$ (for $n < 10$, even $n$ may reach $0$ directly).

\textbf{Proof.} Follows from the corrected analysis above: for odd $n$, the digital root sequence doubles modulo $9$ until an odd digital root is reached, after which digital root $9$ is achieved in at most two more steps. For even $n$, $f(n)$ is a multiple of $9$ in one step unless $n < 10$, in which case $f(n)$ may reach $0$. Thus, the maximum number of steps to digital root $9$ is $5$.
\qed

\subsection{Efficient Cycle Detection Algorithm}
The digital root convergence property enables an efficient algorithm for determining the cycle for any $n$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Precomputation:} Enumerate all cycles for multiples of $9$ up to a large bound $M$ (e.g., $M = 50,000$) using cycle detection algorithms (such as Floyd's algorithm or hash sets). Store these cycles in a lookup table mapping each multiple of $9$ to its cycle representative.
    \item \textbf{Runtime for any $n$:} While $n > M$ or $n$ is not a multiple of $9$, apply $f(n)$ and update $n$ to $f(n)$. If $n = 0$, return $0$. Once $n \leq M$ and $n$ is a multiple of $9$, use the precomputed lookup table to find the cycle that $n$ belongs to. Return the cycle and the path taken to reach it.
\end{enumerate}
This approach is highly efficient: for most $n$, convergence to a multiple of $9$ occurs within $5$ steps for odd $n$ and $1$ step for even $n$, making the runtime very fast. The precomputation for $M = 50,000$ handles most cases, and the algorithm can be extended to larger $M$ if needed. This method combines digital root theory with precomputation and is novel for this function.


\section{Conclusion}
This article has presented a detailed mathematical and computational study of the discrete dynamical system defined by $f(n) = n \pm \operatorname{digit\_sum}(n)$. We have proved new theorems on global convergence and digital root attractors, fully enumerated and visualized all cycles for multiples of $9$ up to $N=100,000$, and compared the behavior for primes, composites, and special classes of integers. Our computational framework enables large-scale analysis and reproducibility, and our results reveal new phenomena in integer dynamics, digital root theory, and cycle enumeration. The article situates these findings within the broader context of number theory and dynamical systems, and outlines several promising directions for future research. We hope this work will serve as a foundation for further exploration of digit-based dynamical systems and their applications. All code, data, and updated figures for $N=100,000$ are provided for reproducibility.
